            Hi! I'm Patrice Virata. I'm currently a Junior at UNO and my major is MIS. I was born and raised in the Philippines and moved to Omaha, Nebraska in 2010. 
            I have two cats and a hamster! My hobbies are playing video games like League of Legends, watercolor painting, and doing my own nails!
            I like to socialize and also make friends! It's nice to meet you!
